### <Hi there, I'm Hugo /> ðŸ‘‹ ðŸŒ±

I am Java Jr Developer and found out that I want to become a Frontend Developer. I am here to have the opportunity to be.

```javascript
const happycodingpy = {
  pronouns: 'he' | 'him',
  code: ['HTML', 'CSS', 'Javascript', 'Python', 'Java'],
  databases: ['MongoDB', 'MySQL', 'PL/SQL'],
  thingsILike: ['Cats, Pizza's', 'Trees', 'Dinosaurs', 'Spaceship in the universe'],
  
  backEnd: {
         java: ['Spring'],
         js: ['Node', "Express"],
         python: ['Flask', 'Django'],
      },
}  
  
```
